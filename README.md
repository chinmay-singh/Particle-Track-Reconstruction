# TrackML_CUHK
###### Due to absence of compute resources I was not able to try out many models and had to use the 100_events sample
#### Since the problem can be treated as a latent variable problem and similar to a clustering problem I decided to use DBSCAN for it.
##### I used the helix transform for coordinate transformation after EDA, I also considered cylindrical transformation and would likely use Hough transform in the upcoming time.
